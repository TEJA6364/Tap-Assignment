                    <p><b>E-authentication system using QR code and OTP:-</b><br>
                        An e-authentication system that uses OTP and QR code technology is a secure and efficient method 
                        for authenticating users in online transactions. This system provides a two-factor authentication 
                        mechanism that is convenient for users and effective in preventing unauthorized access. The user 
                        can select the authentication type as QR Code or OTP. If the user passes the authentication, then 
                        the system will redirect to the main page1.The QR Code and OTP are randomly generated by the system 
                        at the time of login. When using services in a web environment, security is of great importance 
                        especially for both the user and the provider. The information in use must be handled in a way that 
                        does not compromise its security</p>

                    <p><b>Predicting Employee Attrition Using Machine Learning Techniques:-</b><br>
                    Predicting employee attrition using machine learning techniques is a popular topic in the <br>field of human 
                    resources. The goal is to identify employees who are at risk of leaving the<br>company so that proactive 
                    measures can be taken to retain them. Machine learning<br>algorithms can be used to analyze employee data 
                    and identify patterns that are indicative of<br>attrition1.One study used a synthetic data created by IBM 
                    Watson and conducted three main <br>experiments to predict employee attrition. The first experiment involved 
                    training the original <br>class-imbalanced dataset with the following machine learning models: support vector 
                    machine <br>(SVM) with several kernel functions, random forest and K-nearest neighbour (KNN). The second <br>experiment 
                    involved training the original class-imbalanced dataset with the following machine <br> learning models: SVM with 
                    several kernel functions, random forest and KNN.<br>The third experiment involved training the original class-
                    imbalanced dataset with the following <br>machine learning models: SVM with several kernel functions, 
                    random forest and KNN</p>
